# Spotify Ad Muter

Spotify Ad Muter is a Python script that automatically mutes advertisements or other unwanted audio on Spotify. By detecting ad titles, it manages the audio session to mute and unmute Spotify seamlessly, providing users with an uninterrupted music experience.

## Features

- **Automatic Ad Muting**: Instantly detects and mutes Spotify advertisements.
- **Hotkey Controls**:
  - `Ctrl + Shift + F1`: Add the current track to the mute list.
  - `Ctrl + Shift + F3`: Remove the most recently added track from the mute list.
  - `Ctrl + Shift + F4`: Clear the entire mute list.

## Installation and Setup

Simply download and run the `.exe` file once. It will automatically configure itself to run at Windows startup, ensuring it always operates when you start your computer. The script creates a `.json` file in its directory to store your mute list:

- **Adding to Mute List**: Use `Ctrl + Shift + F1` to add the currently playing song or ad to the mute list.
- **Removing from Mute List**: Use `Ctrl + Shift + F3` to remove the last added song from the mute list.
- **Resetting the Mute List**: Use `Ctrl + Shift + F4` to clear all entries from the mute list.

The script functions effectively when Spotify is open or minimized, but not when it is minimized to the tray.

So, if you are listening to unwanted audio on Spotify, just hit `Ctrl + Shift + F1`, and you will never hear it again :)

### Prerequisites

- Windows OS

### What It Is Not

- **Not an Ad Blocker**: This tool does not prevent ads from being played; it merely mutes the audio during ads.
- **Not a Spotify Modifier**: It doesn't alter Spotify’s native behavior or interfere with its normal operation outside of muting.
- **Not an Online App**: This tool works fully offline and locally.
